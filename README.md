# Find_ploynomial-
Write a function named evl_ploynomial that can find the value of 1st degree polynomial (y=ax+b). The function should not input or print. It should take the arguments and return the result. The values are in floating points. o Overload the function that can find the value of 2nd degree polynomial (y= ax2+bx+c). The function should not input or print. This should take the arguments and return the result o *Overload the function that it can accept the array, value of x and size of array. Then it must compute the polynomial assuming as: e.g array is passed with size 4 then it will be considered as ax3+bx2+cx+d and array[3] has d, array[2] has c, array[1] has b and array[0] has a. The function should be able to compute n degree polynomial. Declare an array of size 6 in main and input this array using your defined method in q4. And call the function to compute polynomial in c++
